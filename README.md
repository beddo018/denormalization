# denormalization
This Jupyter Notebook file is my submission for a project specified under Udacity's Data Engineering career-path.

It consists of reference code for creating denormalized Cassandra tables via Python in anticipation of specific queries.

Feel free to use if interested in learning about 1) Apache Cassandra's Python driver; 2) implementing denormalized tables in NoSQL or 3) writing basic Cassandra Query Language (CQL) queries.
